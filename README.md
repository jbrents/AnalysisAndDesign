# AnalysisAndDesign Reflection

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

When I first started this course, I was trying to learn algorithms as if I were learning to code. So, I was looking at all the details, and it made this course very frustrating, because I felt like I was trying to jam-pack a lot of knowledge into my brain all at once. After watching some YouTube videos, I realized the importance of learning patterns and understanding the role of data structures and algorithms in a program's overall performance. This includes optimizing speed, managing memory usage, and leveraging the functions provided by the data structure to avoid reinventing the wheel. The overarching problem is how to store and access this information effectively for college students and their advisors.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

When I first approached the problem, I looked for the fastest data structure, and boom, that was going to be the one I was going to use. Then I read an article my professor had posted about using BSTs over Hash Tables (which was what I wanted to use because of its near-instantaneous speed). That article changed my mind due to its strong opinion on achieving a balance between usable functions from the data structure, maintaining speed, and limiting memory usage. In these areas, the Hash Table is sub-optimal. Having a clear understanding of data structures' strengths and weaknesses is advantageous for writing programs that have specific needs.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

Overcoming roadblocks required some research on my part. Thankfully, the internet is chock full of examples on how to write algorithms, and with the assistance of AI as a sort of 24/7 tutor, it was easier to overcome roadblocks than if this were the 80s or 90s. The hardest part for me was getting a starting point, as I was initially thinking about the project as a whole. However, breaking it down into functions made things a lot easier to get started. So, I started with the menu, and once it was functional, I went to load the data, then to print all courses, and finally to print a specific course.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

After this project, I will weigh my options to determine whether I need speed, memory, or more versatile data structure functions. If I were programming something for the self-driving system in an autonomous vehicle, I would likely use a Hash Table due to its fast access to information. However, for a cheap watch, I would probably use vectors. 

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

This project has evolved my thinking from "I just started programming" to "I am a beginner programmer," as I now consider the broader implications of whether my code will run on specific hardware, rather than just focusing on if it will run, period. It has helped me build confidence in my skills, enabling me to tackle more complex subjects.
